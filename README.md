## Semantic Versioning

This project is going to utilise semantic versioning for its tagging.

[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
